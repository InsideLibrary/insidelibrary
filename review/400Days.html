            <h2>Book Review: 400 Days</h2>
            <h3>Title:</h3> <p>400 Days</p>
            <h3>Author:</h3> <p>Chetan Bhagat</p>
            <h3>Publication:</h3> <p>Thomson Press India Limited</p>
            <h3>Publication Year:</h3> <p>8 Oct 2021</p>
            <h3>Genre:</h3> <p> Detective Novel (Mystery & Romance)</p>
            <h3>Language:</h3> <p>English</p>
            <h3>About the Author</h3> <p>This beautiful book is penned down by the very famous and one of the best-selling novel writers of India, Chetan Bhagat. His first book, "Five Point Someone," was published in 2004. He is the author of ten best-selling novels, which have sold over 12 million copies and have been translated into over twelve languages worldwide. The New York Times has called him the 'Biggest Selling Author in India's History.' Time magazine named him 'One of the 100 Most Influential People in the World.' Many of his books have been adapted into films, and he also has won one Filmfare award. He writes columns for famous newspapers like "The Times of India" and "Dainik Bhaskar." He is also a leading motivational speaker. He went to college at IIT Delhi and IIM Ahmedabad, after which he worked in investment banking for a decade before quitting his job to become a full-time writer.</p>
            <h3>About the Book</h3> <p>This book is an imaginary narrative fiction related to kidnapping, mystery, love, romance, and detective work. In this book, the writer has successfully reached his desire. I think to compose this book, the writer got inspiration from men's creepy mentality and from mother-daughter or mother-son relationships. We can say this is also a kind of inspirational book because it inspires you to follow your passion thoroughly and to achieve success in the field , in which you are interested. Through this book, there would definitely be some changes in the creepy mentality of people. Through this book, the writer is able to show the problems faced by couples who do inter-caste marriage. Also, this book is able to show different roles played by a woman at a time, like a soft-hearted youth, beautiful wife, caring and possessive mother, and most importantly, warrior woman. The specialty of this book is the different plots included according to the story that make this more interesting.</p>
            <h3>Language of the Book and Writing Style</h3> <p>The writer has used very simple, beautiful, and sweet language in the book. The narration of the book is very classy and sticks to the grammar throughout the entire book. It is a small kind of novel with 344 pages. Though the story of the book keeps roaming from the present, the writer has clearly separated the content of past and future chapter-wise.</p>
            <h3>My Opinion About the Book</h3> <p>I think everyone must read this book because if we read this book, then our thinking will change optimistically, and our relationships with our parents, our kids, our neighbors, and our friends would also become good, and we would also become more alert about cyber crimes. I like this book very much.</p>

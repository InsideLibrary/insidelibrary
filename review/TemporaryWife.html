            <h3>About the Author</h3>
            <p>Roberta Leigh, born Rita Shulman, was a prolific British romance novelist and television producer.
                Writing under various pseudonyms, including Roberta Leigh, she authored numerous romance novels that
                captured the hearts of readers with their emotional intensity and compelling characters. Leigh’s works
                often centered on the themes of love, misunderstanding, and personal transformation. "Temporary Wife" is
                one of her classic romance novels, embodying her signature style of emotional drama and passionate
                relationships.</p>
            <h3>About the Book</h3>
            <p>"Temporary Wife" by Roberta Leigh tells the story of Caroline Lang, who agrees to a marriage of
                convenience with the successful businessman Grant Cameron. Caroline enters this arrangement out of
                financial necessity, but what starts as a practical solution soon turns into an emotional rollercoaster.
                As Caroline and Grant navigate their new relationship, they are confronted with unexpected feelings,
                misunderstandings, and the possibility of genuine love. The book explores themes of love, pride,
                vulnerability, and the complexities of romantic relationships set against the backdrop of 1970s social
                expectations.</p>
            <h3>Language of the Book and Writing Style</h3>
            <p>Roberta Leigh’s writing in "Temporary Wife" is both classic and engaging, reflecting the style typical of
                romance novels from the 1970s. The language is straightforward, yet it effectively conveys the emotional
                turmoil and growing attraction between the characters. Leigh uses dialogue to build tension and bring
                out the internal struggles of both protagonists. At around 190 pages, "Temporary Wife" is a relatively
                short novel, but Leigh manages to pack in a lot of emotional depth and romantic development within its
                concise structure. The writing evokes a nostalgic feel, particularly for fans of vintage romance novels.
            </p>
            <h3>My Opinion About the Book</h3>
            <p>"Temporary Wife" by Roberta Leigh is a delightful, old-fashioned romance that will appeal to readers who
                enjoy classic love stories with a marriage-of-convenience trope. Caroline and Grant's dynamic is filled
                with tension, misunderstandings, and slow-burning affection that builds as the story progresses. While
                the plot may feel predictable at times, the emotional stakes keep readers invested in the characters’
                journey. Roberta Leigh’s ability to capture the emotional complexity of love and vulnerability makes
                this a charming read. If you're a fan of vintage romance or looking for a quick, heartfelt story,
                "Temporary Wife" is a great choice.</p>

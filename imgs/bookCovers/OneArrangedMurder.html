            <h3>About the Book</h3>
            <p>"One Arranged Murder" is a mystery thriller set against the backdrop of a typical Indian arranged
                marriage. The story revolves around Keshav and Saurabh, two best friends who run a private detective
                agency. On the night of his fiancée Prerna’s karva chauth, Saurabh eagerly waits to break her fast, but
                she never arrives. Soon after, Prerna is found dead, apparently having fallen from the terrace. However,
                Keshav and Saurabh suspect foul play and begin investigating what they believe to be a murder. The novel
                combines elements of humor, suspense, and family drama as the duo navigate through a complex web of
                family secrets, love, and betrayal to uncover the truth behind Prerna’s death.</p>

                simple and conversational, making the book accessible to a wide range of readers. Bhagat blends suspense
                with humor, maintaining a balance between the mystery and the light-hearted banter between Keshav and
                Saurabh. The characters are relatable, and the plot keeps readers hooked with its twists and
                revelations. The novel’s use of contemporary, everyday language makes it an easy read, while the blend

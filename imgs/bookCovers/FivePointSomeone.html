            <h3>About the Author</h3>
            <p>Chetan Bhagat, born on 22 April 1974, is a well-known Indian author, columnist, and motivational speaker.
                He is regarded as one of India's most influential contemporary writers, especially in the genre of
                popular fiction. Before becoming a full-time writer, Bhagat worked as an investment banker. His books
                often reflect the lives, struggles, and aspirations of Indian youth, making him a widely relatable
                figure among younger readers. Several of his books have been adapted into Bollywood films. *Five Point
                Someone* is one of his most famous works and was later adapted into the hit movie *3 Idiots*.</p>
            <h3>About the Book</h3>
            <p>*Five Point Someone* is a story set in the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Delhi, and
                revolves around three friends—Hari, Ryan, and Alok—who struggle with academic pressures, personal
                relationships, and self-identity. The book has short but very interesting plot and the author has packed
                this delicious meal in just 284 pages. The title "Five Point Someone" refers to the low GPA of the trio,
                which places them at the bottom of the academic ranking system. The novel delves into how academic
                performance is often prioritized over creativity, self-growth, and emotional well-being. Bhagat provides
                a humorous yet insightful commentary on the rigid educational system in India while exploring themes of
                friendship, ambition, and personal conflict.</p>
            <h3>Language of the Book and Writing Style</h3>
            <p>Chetan Bhagat's writing is characterized by its simplicity and readability. He uses colloquial language,
                making the book easy to connect with for the average Indian reader. The book is written in first-person
                narration from Hari's perspective, and Bhagat blends humor with the emotional ups and downs of college
                life. Despite being light-hearted at many points, the novel also presents some deeper issues regarding
                the flaws of an overcompetitive education system.</p>
            <h3>My Opinion About the Book</h3>
            <p>*Five Point Someone* is a highly entertaining and relatable book, especially for students and young
                adults. It offers a refreshing take on college life in India, portraying the struggles of students who
                don't conform to the stereotypical image of overachievers. The book highlights the importance of
                friendships and the value of pursuing one's passions rather than merely following societal expectations.
                While not the most critically acclaimed novel, it’s an easy and enjoyable read that has resonated with
                many, and the humor makes it quite engaging. Overall, it’s a good pick for those looking for light
                fiction with a message.</p>
